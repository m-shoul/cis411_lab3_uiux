### Searching For a Job

![Search 1](../assets/Indeed/Search1.png)
![Search 2](../assets/Indeed/Search2.png)
![Search 2](../assets/Indeed/Search3.png)

To search for a job, I navigate back to the [home page](https://www.indeed.com/) where I can specify what job I am looking for and where. After adding in my search criteria, the [results page](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Software+Development+Internship&l=Hanover%2C+PA&from=searchOnHP&vjk=fc381b7fc1656ccb) shows what is currently open, with options to further refine the search criteria. If I find a job I am interested in, I can click *Apply now* or *Apply on company site* to apply for the listing.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | <center> 3 | Overall, this site is very intuitive and I always knew exactly where I was and what I needed to do on each page. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | <center>  3 | Everything was concise, easy to use, and I was able to search for a job or access my profile quickly and efficiently. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | <center> 3 | The site has a good visual hierarchy with not much noise and distraction. I like how the page is broken up into sections, and it is obvious what is clickable with the blue and white contrast. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | <center> 3 | The site told me to search for a job by having both search bars in the center of the screen with the blue *search* button just off to the right. Once I found a job, the blue *apply* button told me to apply for the listing. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | <center> 2 | The use of copy for this site is decent, where some areas have enough detail to prove the point, but in others not so much. Sometimes I feel like there was a bit too much white space and that some pages looked too boring. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | <center> 1 | It is easy to know where you are pertaining to the three pages in the main navigation bar, but the small blue line was sometimes hard to read. When navigating through the various sections of my account, it was hard to know exactly where I was or how to get back. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | <center> 2 | The accessibility of this sight is about average in comparison of other sites I have come across. It is easy to navigate without a mouse, but there are no features for visually impaired or audio deficient users.|
| **TOTAL** | <center> 17  |   |

| Postconditions | The user will have an item listed to sell. |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1: [Facebook Marketplace]([www.awesomesauce.com](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace))
2. Competitor 2: [Craigslist](https://harrisburg.craigslist.org/location/harrisburg-pa?lat=40.34800&lon=-76.80700&search_distance=11.00000)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Navigate to Facebook Marketplace.  | We will ask the user to navigate to Facebook Marketplace while sitting in front of a computer device.  |
| 2 | Log in or create an account.  |   |
| 3 | Find a lawn mower to purchase.  |   |
| 4 | Save the listing they are interested in. |   |
| 5 | Go back to the Facebook Marketplace home page.  |   |
| 6 | Navigate to the listing they just saved.  |   |


## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions


| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Navigate to Facebook Marketplace.  | The user was able to navigate to Facebook Marketplace with ease. He searched *Facebook Marketplace* in the Google search bar and clicked on the first result. This took him to Facebook Marketplace. |
| 2 | Log in or create an account.  | The user did not have an account, so he created one. He filled out the form to register for an account. This includes entering a first and last name, mobile number or email, password, birthday, and gender. He logged into his account once his account was successfully registered. |
| 3 | Find a lawn mower to purchase.  | The user found the search bar and searched for *lawn mower*. The listings came up and he scrolled through the listings till he found which one was most appealing to him. Once he found the one he wanted he clicked on it and an enlarged view of the listing popped up on the same page.  |
| 4 | Save the listing they are interested in. | When I asked the user to save the listing, he spent some time looking for where the save button was. He became a bit frustrated as it was not obvious as to how to save an item. After some time he hovered over the save icon out of curiosity, and an alt text saying *save* popped up. He became excited and saved the listing. |
| 5 | Go back to the Facebook Marketplace home page.  | When asked to go back to the home page, the user was initially confused and described how he did not know how to get back to the home page. He clicked on the Facebook icon that took him back to the Facebook home page, but not the Facebook Marketplace homepage. Eventually, he clicked on the Facebook Marketplace icon in the navigation bar, which took him back to the Facebook Marketplace home page.  |
| 6 | Navigate to the listing they just saved.  | During this step, the user expected it to be harder than it actually was. The user was clicking lots of different buttons and scrolling up and down pages trying to find the saved listings, but found no luck. It came to a point where the user became so frustrated that he gave up looking for the listing he just saved. He was frustrated because from the Facebook Marketplace home page, there is no simple and fast way to get back to the saved listings. |
